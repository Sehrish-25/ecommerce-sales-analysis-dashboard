# Ecommece-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard (Interactive Dashboard Creation Using Microsoft Excel)
## Project Objective
The objective of the E-commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard is to provide clear insights into key business metrics such as total sales, profit, and product performance. It helps track Year-over-Year growth, identify top-performing categories and regions, and evaluate customer segment profitability. By visualizing these key performance indicators, the dashboard enables data-driven decision-making, helping businesses optimize strategies and improve overall performance.

## Process
- Data Collection:
Extracted raw e-commerce sales data which included fields like order date, ship date,	customer ID, sales, quantity, profit, etc.
- Data Cleaning:
Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized date formats which ensured consistency in category names.
- Data Preparation:
Added calculated fields, such as profit margin and YoY growth. Furthermore, aggregated data for metrics like total sales, profit, and order count.
- Dashboard Creation in Excel:
Used pivot tables and pivot charts to organize the data dynamically. Created interactive visualizations, including : Line charts for YoY growth,Bar charts for category-wise and subcategory-wise profit analysis, Geographic maps for sales distribution by state and Pie charts for segment-wise performance. Added slicers for filtering data by year, region, and customer segment.
- Design and Formatting:
Used consistent color coding for easy data interpretation and placed KPIs (e.g., sales, profit, orders) prominently at the top for quick insights.
